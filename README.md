# js-library
The first project from the Javascript course in The Odin Project.  The goal is to get practice with Objects and prototypes by creating a simple library webpage.

The page will display information about all of the books in the "library".  The user can add new books by using a form.  There is no backend on this project so
books will not be stored between page loads.

The CSS is rather barebones on this project because the focus is more on Objects and DOM manipulation.
